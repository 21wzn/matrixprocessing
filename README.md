 Kernel Image Processing
 - This Java Applet allows you to process image files using kernels. It already has a few hardcoded kernels, such as the standard 3x3 and 5x5 Gaussian Blur kernels, edge detection  kernels as well as sharpening kernels. 
- The implementation of the JavaFX framework provides an easily navigable UI to help the user accomplish their goals.
## Features
- Gaussian Blur Kernels
- Edge Detection Kernels
- Edge Enhancing Kernels
- Sharpening Masks
- Unsharpening Masks
- Custom Kernels
- Color Inversion
- Black and White
## To-do list
- Implement multithreading to increase performance
- Implement color grading sliders (contrast, brightness, saturation)
- Implement low quality real-time preview
- Customize UI with CSS
- Refactor the hardcoded kernels to make use of the custom kernel interface paired with properties files
